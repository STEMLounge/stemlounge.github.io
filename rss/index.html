Given a set of cities along with the cost of travel between them, the TSP asks you to find the shortest round trip that visits each city and returns to your starting city.</p><p>Nobody has been able to come up with a way of solving it in polynomial time. We’re not sure if it's even possible.</p><p>Harvard's Hassler Whitney first coined the name "Travelling Salesman Problem" during a lecture at Princeton in 1934. It became known in the United States as the 48-states problem, referring to the challenge of visiting each of the 48 state capitols in the shortest possible tour. Alaska and Hawaii weren’t US states back then. </p><h3 id="dantzig49">Dantzig49</h3><p>Dantzig49 was the first non-trivial TSP problem ever solved. It’s a variant of Whitney’s 48 states problem, using one city for each state, plus Washington DC. The road distances used in Dantzig49 were those available on a Rand McNally map, so not all cities were state capitals.</p><p>There are <code>(n-1!)/2</code> possible tours to any TSP problem, so Dantzig49 has 6,206,957,796,268,036,335,431,144,523,686,687,519,260,743,177,338,880,000,000,000 possible tours (~6.2 novemdecillion tours). If you ask a computer to check all of those tours to find the shortest one, long after everyone who is alive today is gone it will still be trying to find the answer.</p><p>The large (factorial) brute-force search space of the TSP doesn’t inherently mean there can’t be efficient ways to solve the TSP. There are other problems that have even larger search spaces, yet we have algorithms that can efficiently solve them. The <code>Minimum Spanning Tree</code> problem is one example. But without an efficient algorithm for the TSP, this factorial search space contributes to the TSP’s difficulty.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/12/d49_optimum.gif" class="kg-image" alt="11 Animated Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem"><figcaption>The optimum solution to Dantzig49.

They introduced novel techniques, enabling them to solve Dantzig49 without inspecting all possible tours. They did it by hand, using a pin-board and rope. Their work paved the way for new heuristics.</p><h3 id="np-and-p">NP and P</h3><p>We can't quickly find the optimal solution to a TSP problem. Our best-known exact solving techniques can take a long time for even a modest number of cities. Specifically, we can't solve them in polynomial time. We also can't quickly verify the solutions even when we have them. This makes it an <code>NP-Hard</code> problem. It has a variant that can be written as a yes/no question. That 'decision' variant is <code>NP-Complete</code>. NP-Complete problems also can't be solved in polynomial time, but their solutions can be verified in polynomial time. </p><p>Not all problems take too long to solve, though. We group the problems that we can quickly solve (in polynomial time) as <code>P</code>.</p><p>It could be possible that a quick method for solving an NP-Complete problem exists, and we just haven't found it yet, making P=NP. Or, it could be impossible for a quick method to exist. Knowing which one of these two possibilities is true is a million dollar question <sup>[6][7]</sup>.</p><p>The TSP's solvability has implications beyond just computational efficiency. One of the unsolved questions in Economics is whether markets are efficient. There is proof that markets are efficient if and only if P = NP <sup>[8]</sup>. This has implications on the type of economic policies governments enact. Free market vs regulated market, small government vs big government, etc.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><ul><li>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing</a></li><li>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm#Algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm#Algorithm</a></li><li>[3] Croes, G.A.

It's produced by many firearms manufacturers, including Colt Manufacturing Company [1]. Although they didn't design the AR-15, for many years Colt was responsible for all AR-15 production. Fast forward to today and they've made the decision to stop production of their AR-15. Why is a company that was once responsible for all AR-15 production choosing to stop manufacturing it now? With gun control a debate topic in this upcoming election, rumors are spreading that Colt wants to distance themselves from the AR-15. Could these rumors be true? There's one other fact that isn't making as many headlines, but can probably cue us in to what's really going on:</p><p>Colt is suspending its production of <em><em>all</em></em> rifles for the civilian market. Not just the AR-15.</p><p>After 183 years of manufacturing guns for civilians, has Colt suddenly decided that guns shouldn't be manufactured for civilians? This is highly unlikely. We can be fairly certain that ending civilian rifle production is a business decision for Colt. One that manufacturing businesses make all the time. To understand why, let's observe the forces of nature that are in play using basic economics as our lens.</p><h2 id="the-economics-of-manufacturing">THE ECONOMICS OF MANUFACTURING</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/stemlounge_economics_manufacturing.GIF" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Manufacturing businesses regularly make decisions as to whether they should continue manufacturing their products. How does a manufacturer know if it should continue producing a product? </p><p>In simple terms, if a business is able to sell a product for more than it costs to produce it, then it can choose to produce the product and make a profit.</p><p>Simple. But probably a little too simple. There are different types of costs, and different costs can matter whether you're making decisions for the short term or the long term. So, what costs influence decision marking?</p><h3 id="fixed-costs-and-variable-costs">Fixed Costs and Variable Costs</h3><p>Every company has costs. It is true that you need to spend money in order to make money. Economists have come up with two meaningful ways to describe the costs that a business incurs during operation: fixed costs and variable costs. This way of looking at costs is particularly useful for manufacturing companies.</p><p><code>Total Cost = Total Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs</code></p><p><strong>Fixed Costs</strong> are costs that stay the same, even as you produce more or less. Fixed costs are committed costs, such as rent and salaries and overhead. If you're capable of producing up to 10,000 units, then your fixed costs will be the same whether you choose to produce 0, 1, or 10,000 units. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/fixed_cost_stemlounge_animated.GIF" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Variable Costs</strong> are costs that increase the more you produce. If your production capacity is 10,000 units, then your variable costs will be the lowest when you produce 0 units, and the highest when you produce 10,000 units.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/variabl_cost_stemlounge.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="per-unit-price">Per-Unit Price</h3><p><strong>Per-unit Price </strong>is the average price that an item sells for. Mathematically it can be expressed as <code>per-unit price = total price / number of units sold</code>. </p><p>If 10 AR-15s will sell for a total price of $10,000, then their <em>per-unit Price</em> is <code>$10,000 / 10 AR-15s</code> = <code>$1,000 per AR-15</code>. In practice, the <em>per-unit price</em> can just be the list-price. If each AR-15 produced will sell with a price tag of $1,000, then the <em>per-unit price</em> is <code>$1,000 per AR-15</code>. Depending on how a business does their accounting, any refunds, price-changes over time, and unsold inventories can complicate this. But let's not. For our purposes, let's assume each Colt AR-15 has a <em>per-unit price</em> of <code>$1,000 per AR-15</code>. Note that <em>per-unit price</em> is what each unit sells for on average, not what the company pays to produce them.</p><h3 id="per-unit-costs">Per-Unit Costs</h3><p>In manufacturing, total costs can be spread out over large production quantities. So it's useful to look at costs on a per-unit basis. </p><p><strong>Per-unit Fixed Cost</strong> is the fixed cost that a business incurs in order to produce one unit. <code>per-unit fixed cost = fixed cost / number of units produced</code>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/fixed_cost_per_unit_stemlounge.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Remember how fixed costs don't change the more you produce? The more units you produce, the lower your <em>per-unit fixed costs</em> are. Let's say Colt's fixed costs are <code>$10,000/day</code>, and their production capacity for AR-15's is <code>100/day</code>. If they produce just one AR-15 and call it a day, then on that day their <em>per-unit fixed cost</em> = <code>($10,000)/(1 AR-15)</code> = <code>$10,000 per AR-15</code>. But if they max out production and produce 100 AR-15's, then their <em>per-unit fixed cost</em> = <code>($10,000)/(100 AR-15s)</code>= <code>$100 per AR-15</code>. As you can see, Colt's <em>per-unit fixed cost </em>will go down the more they produce. If they make just one AR-15 per day, then they'll have to sell them for at least $10,000 each to cover fixed costs. But if they make 100 AR-15s per day, then the per-unit price will need to be at least $100 to cover fixed costs. As far as <em>per-unit fixed costs</em> are concerned, it pays to produce more.</p><p><strong>Per-unit Variable Cost</strong> is the variable cost that a business incurs in order to produce a certain number of units. <code>per-unit variable cost = variable cost / number of units produced</code>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/variable_cost_per_unit_stemlounge.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The variable cost that is incurred to produce an additional unit is known as a marginal cost. Sometimes the marginal cost can change as you produce more and more units. But at constant production it can be treated as the same cost per-unit on average. We can treat Colt's per-unit variable cost as constant for our purposes. Let's say Colt's per-unit variable cost is <code>$500 per AR-15</code>. </p><p>If they produce just a single AR-15 and call it a day, then the total variable cost for producing 1 AR-15 is <code>(per-unit variable cost)*(number of units produced)</code> =  <code>$500/AR-15 * (1 AR-15)</code>= <code>$500</code>. If they max out capacity and produce 100 AR-15s in a day, then the total variable cost for producing those 100 AR-15s is <code>(per-unit variable cost)*(number of units produced)</code> =  <code>$500/AR-15 * (100 AR-15s)</code>= <code>$50,000</code>. How does per-unit variable cost relate to total variable cost? As you produce more units, the <em>per-unit variable cost</em> stays the same, but the total variable cost increases.</p><p>Just like total cost = fixed cost + variable cost, <strong>per-unit Total Cost</strong> = <code>per-unit fixed cost + the per-unit variable cost</code>. It's the total cost that a business incurs in order to produce one unit. Both fixed costs and variable costs factor in to the per-unit Total Cost. And it's higher at lower poduction quantities. </p><h3 id="one-final-cost">One final cost</h3><p>People make choices between things. There is a hidden cost that you make with every decision that you make. When you make a choice to do something, there are probably other things that you could have chosen to do instead. The <strong>opportunity cost</strong> is the highest value of the other options that you could have chosen instead of the one you chose. </p><p>Let's say Colt has a production capacity of <code>100 guns / day</code> and they have manufactured 99 guns so far today. For their final gun, they produce a particular gun model that will sell at a marginal profit of <code>$300</code>. Sounds great, right? They made money, didn't they? Well, that decision carries an opportunity cost. Let's say there's a different gun model that they could have produced instead with a marginal profit of <code>$600</code>. In this scenario, the opportunity cost of producing a gun that brings in $300 in additional profit is <code> $600 </code>. Without considering the opportunity cost, they don't know that they could have done better by producing a different gun. This opportunity cost is a variable cost. They incur this kind of opportunity cost for each additional gun that they manufacture.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/opportunity_cost_stemlounge.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-production-at-scale">The Advantages and Disadvantages of Production at Scale</h3><p>As you increase production, your per-unit variable cost may stay the same, but your per-unit fixed cost reduces. So as you increase production, your per-unit total cost may reduce. If most of your costs are fixed costs, then as you increase production, your per-unit total cost can drastically reduce. Manufacturing companies with relatively high fixed costs produce items in large quantities in order to take advantage of the nature of fixed costs to increase profits. </p><p>These cost advantages over larger production quantities are known as <strong>economies of scale</strong>. They're the reason airplane tickets can be relatively cheap, considering passenger airplanes cost hundreds of millions of dollars and a single flight uses tens of thousands of dollars of gasoline. Due to their impact on per-unit total cost as well as being a barrier to entry, fixed costs are wonderful when more and more people are buying your products. </p><p>However fixed costs make up total costs and in order to cover total costs you need to produce at least the quantity known as the <strong>minimum efficient scale of operation</strong>. Only use the plane once and fly just a single passenger, and the plane ticket will have to be over $100,000,000 just to cover costs. Fly multiple times per day with a full plane and a single plane ticket can be just a couple hundred dollars to cover costs. So fixed costs are a burden when less and less people are buying your products. They're also a burden when new technology makes the fixed costs unnecessary for new competitors to compete.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/minimum_efficient_scale.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="when-do-you-decide-to-halt-production">When do you decide to halt production?</h3><blockquote>One must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop averts trouble. <br>― Lao Tsu</blockquote><p>Earlier I wrote "if a business is able to sell a product for a higher price than it costs to produce it, then it can choose to produce the product and make a profit." Now that we know how economists and managers like to look at costs, which costs matter when deciding when to produce? How does all of this play into Colt deciding not to produce civilian rifles anymore?</p><p>When the fixed costs are already paid for, they should not matter in future decision making. These are known as sunk costs, and you should let bygones be bygones.</p><p>In practice, fixed costs are already committed in the short-run. This means that in the <em>short-run</em>, when considering whether to produce, variable costs are all that matter.

We can assume that Colt manufactures multiple rifles for different markets in some of the same manufacturing plants, not just civilian rifles like the AR-15. </li><li>Colt's military and law enforcement weapons are paid for by steady government contracts, but their civilian rifle sales are subject to the consumer market. </li></ul><p>Knowing this, and the microeconomic principles covered in this article, what can we infer about Colt's decision to stop production of <em>all</em> rifles for the civilian market?</p><p>It's likely that in recent years, sales of Colt's civilian rifles have not been as high as they once were. There's new competition offering cooler guns or lower priced guns, or there are just a lot of guns on the market, much more supply than is demanded. Despite the declining sales<em> </em>of Colt's civilian rifles, and increasing <em>opportunity costs</em> of producing the civilian rifles, each year Colt has been able to cover their <em>per-unit Variable Costs of producing civilian rifles. </em>So they have continued to produce. However, more time has gone by and decisions need to be made again. This time around, there's two possibilities. Both with the same outcome. </p><ul><li>Possibility 1: They're looking at the next year or accounting period and they're unable to cover these <em>per-unit variable costs of producing civilian rifles </em>for the short-run. There is downward pressure on per-unit price, and their opportunity costs are going up as they could be producing guns that will bring in more revenue.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/per_unit_price_variable_cost_stemlounge-2-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><ul><li>Possibility 2: They're looking into the foreseeable future and they're unable to cover the <em>per-unit total costs of producing civilian rifles</em> in the long-run. Fixed costs such as building leases and factory wages are up for renewal. They now have to be factored in to their decision-making, raising the bar of minimum profitability for all of their guns.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/09/per_unit_price_total_cost_stemlounge-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Why is Colt ending AR-15 Production? - Infographic - animated"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So they have chosen to postpone production of civilian market rifles.<em> </em>They may have had no other choice, since a surplus of unsold inventory may have required them to reduce total production to a point where they no longer have a <em>minimum efficient scale of operation</em>. This would be worse than just shutting down production of civilian rifles, reclaiming the <em>opportunity cost</em>, putting those resources towards the more profitable government weapons, and supplying civilian rifles from stockpiled inventory to meet lower consumer demand for their rifles, while maintaining a profitable <em>per-unit price</em>.</p><p>We came to this conclusion inferring from basic economics. How does this align with what Colt's CEO is saying from the trenches?</p><blockquote>“We want to assure you that Colt is committed to the Second Amendment. ... . The fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity. Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.”<br><br>– Dennis Veilleux, CEO, Colt.</blockquote><p>Bull's eye.</p><p>Comes to show the power of applying basic microeconomics. Colt is a firearms manufacturer. They make guns for a living. Ending civilian rifle production is likely a business decision for Colt, not a political one. They're not selling their civilian rifles fast enough to justify producing more of them in the quantities that they can afford to produce. Companies discontinue lower margin products all the time to focus on products with higher margins.</p><p>Dennis' statement is in direct response to rumors that external pressures are the reason for stopping civilian rifle production. How do you think this will play out? Will gun-buyers see this as an attack on the 2nd amendment and retaliate by boycotting Colt firearms?</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>[1] Founded in 1855, Colt Manufacturing Company rose to prominence through their contributions to conflicts spanning the 1850's through World War 1, and to the field of manufacturing.

Where does fertilization take place in the moss life cycle? Scroll to the Key Takeaways to get the answer, or start from the top to learn about the moss life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="reproduction">REPRODUCTION</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mosses have two forms of reproduction: <strong>sexual reproduction</strong> and <strong>asexual</strong>/ <strong>vegetative reproduction</strong>. This is true for all <strong>bryophytes</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practically all flowering plants are diploid, but for mosses, this is different. Mosses alternate between diploid generations (as sporophytes) and haploid generations (as gametophytes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sexualreproduction">SEXUAL REPRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, sexual reproduction is the process where genes from two different parents mix to produce offspring with a genetic makeup similar to, but different from, each parent.</p>
<p>The sexual reproduction of the moss (bryophyte) life cycle alternates between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte phases. In a nutshell, haploid gametophytes produce haploid gametes, which can be sperm or eggs. When egg and sperm merge, they form a diploid zygote which grows into a diploid sporophyte. Sporophytes produce haploid spores, containing genetic information from both haploid gametophyte parents. A spore gives rise to a haploid gametophyte, completing the cycle.</p>
<h4 id="gametophyte">Gametophyte</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single <strong>gametophyte</strong> moss plant can produce both sperm and eggs. This can occur on different parts of the same plant, one part producing sperm and another part producing eggs. However, a plant usually produces either all sperm-producing organs or all egg-producing organs at any one time. This way it doesn't breed with itself, promoting genetic variation. The female structure for producing eggs is known as the <strong>archegonium</strong>, and the male structure for producing sperm is known as the <strong>antheridium</strong>. Antheridia are tiny, typically stalked, club-shaped or spherical structures. Archegonia are bottle-like containers, their wall just one cell thick. Archegonia are typically formed in groups. Archegonia and antheridia are usually bundled in leaf rosettes similar to flowers, called <strong>perichaetia</strong>. Elongated club-shaped cell filaments called <strong>Paraphyse</strong> are sometimes found on the gametophyte, storing water and protecting the archegonia sand antheridia from drying up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the antheridia are ripe and the flower gets wet from rain, numerous <strong>antherozoids</strong> (spermatozoids / sperm cells), are released. Antherozoids are only able to move underwater. They swim using two threadlike tails. Some successfully end up on female gametophyte moss plants and are chemically attracted to the archegonium. Each archegonium holds one egg, in a swollen section called the <strong>venter</strong>. The sperm enter the archegonium through the narrow channel in its <strong>neck</strong>. Fertilization occurs in the archegonium to form a diploid <strong>zygote</strong>. Once one archegonium in a group has been fertilized, in many cases the others lose the ability to be fertilized. This is caused by an inhibitory hormone released from the fertilized archegonium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formation of the zygote begins the second phase of the moss life cycle, where the zygote develops into a diploid <strong>sporophyte</strong> (spore-plant).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sporophyte">Sporophyte</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After fertilization, the archegonium on the gametophyte plant becomes modified into a protective sheath around the young sporophyte. The sporophyte begins to grow by mitosis (diploid cell division) out of the top of the archegonium. It elongates and after a few cell divisions begins differentiation. At this point the sporophyte is practically a parasite on the gametophyte plant, although it may produce some food of its own via photosynthesis in the early stages of growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The embryonic sporophyte consists of three structures: a foot, seta, and a capsule. The <strong>foot</strong>, on the lower portion, anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte via penetration and helps to transfer water and nutrients from the gametophyte. The <strong>seta</strong> is a long erect supporting stalk. At the end of the sporophyte is a pod-like <strong>capsule</strong> where <strong>spores</strong> are produced. The seta only occurs in species where the mature capsule is stalked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer cells</strong> develop at the sporophyte-gametophyte boundary in the majority of bryophytes, but not all. These specialized cells allow efficient transfer of nutrients from the gametophyte to the sporophyte. They may form on the gametophyte, sporophyte, or both. The gametophyte-sporophyte junction is often convoluted and maze-like. This increases the surface area, allowing for more transfer cells than a simple boundary, thus increasing the rate at which nutrients can flow to the sporophyte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A capsule may contain four to over a million spores, depending on the species. It also may be stalked or stalkless depending on the species. In most mosses, the mouth of the capsule is covered by a lid-like <strong>operculum</strong>, which falls off when the spores are mature. A membranous hood, the <strong>calyptra</strong>, which is also discarded at maturity, further protects the operculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In wet conditions the spores can't travel very far. A tiny tooth-like structure around the mouth of the capsule controls the release of the spores. These structures, called the <strong>peristome</strong>, consist of one or two rows of teeth. They prevent the release of the spores during wet conditions by remaining closed. In dry conditions they open, releasing the spores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each spore contains a mix of genes from the two parents. If the spore falls onto a damp area of ground, it may <strong>germinate</strong> into a branching, threadlike filamentous <strong>protonema</strong>. Cusps bud from the protonema then grow into leafy male or female gametophytes, completing the life cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asexualreproduction">ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to sexual reproduction, mosses can reproduce asexually (vegetatively). The method they use to accomplish this depends on the situation they're in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the stem of a large clump of moss dies back, the stem-less clump becomes individual plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When bits of the stem or even a single leaf from the moss plant are broken off, these bits can then regenerate to form a new plant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keytakeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the moss life cycle, fertilization takes place in the archegonium of the gametophyte.</li>
<li>Mosses have diploid and haploid generations.</li>
<li>Gametophytes, spores, sperm, and eggs are all haploid.</li>
<li>Zygotes and their resulting sporophytes are diploid.</li>
<li>Mosses can reproduce sexually or asexually.</li>
<li>Moss sperm-release needs the rain, but spore-release needs it to not be raining.</li>
<li>The sporophyte is nourished at least partially by the gametophyte. If they didn't belong to the same species, we'd classify the the sporophyte as a parasite of the gametophyte.</li>

But there’s an unanswered question. Did every single person inside a given county cast the same vote? Or, were the voters within the counties divided? This graph doesn’t show this information. It just shows which choice won, even if it was by one vote. So we decide to blend each county’s red and blue vote ratios together, instead of letting the winner take all. This way if we get a pure red or pure blue county, then we know that everybody casted the same vote. And if we get a purple county, then the voters were divided. This is the result:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yp4SwnfvIA9vs_e-e_gbyg.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>A nice blend revealing smooth purple transitions between red and blue regions. We can now see that there was hardly a landslide victory in any county. But there’s still a problem. When looking at some of the purple counties, it can be hard to decipher if the purple is leaning more towards red or blue. And it gets difficult the closer the counties get to 50/50 red/blue. In fact a R&gt;B county can be confused as a R&lt;B county depending on adjacent colors. In an attempt to see the margins within the counties, we end up with something that’s close, but no cigar. What’s wrong?</p><p>The problem is that in the purple map we’re no longer discerning between two distinct hues (a specific red hue and specific blue hue), but an indiscrete number of purple hues found in-between red and blue.</p><p>Magenta (I will call purple this from now on) is what our brain registers when we observe an equal mixture of red and blue light with the absence of green. We created the purple map because pure red and pure blue counties didn’t show us the vote margins. But <em>the purple hues are nonsense</em>. We end up looking for the quality of red-ness or blue-ness inside each purple hue to create sense. We don’t need purple at all.</p><p><strong><strong>So is there a way for us to blend together red and blue hues without creating any new nonsensical hues in the process?</strong></strong></p><p>Of course! We add green, and we get a Neutralizing election map:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*og37eRaKv4pe7_2vIAkvPw.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Interesting. How does this work? Basic color theory.</p><p>We can describe all colors as combinations of Red, Green, and Blue light. Earlier, we established that Magenta is the mixture of Red and Blue light, with the key absence of Green. But we don’t have any reservations about the absence of green for our purposes. We just want to create a gradient between red and blue. So instead of falling victim to Magenta, we can use Green to neutralize the purple-ranged colors.</p><p>For a given purple-ranged hue, if we take the weaker intensity value of that purple’s Red and Blue components — let’s call that value J — and then set the purple’s green component to that J value, the purple disappears. What’s left behind is either red or blue- whichever one was stronger in the original purple.</p><p>So if we take RGB[175/0/150] and Neutralize it to RGB[175/150/150], then the red hue sticks out, with some desaturation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gM4VXa18eCFiehDA-mNytw.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If we take RGB[150/0/175] and Neutralize it to RGB[150/150/175], then the blue hue sticks out, with some desaturation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DfnsVryvN6oB61dUcHRr8g.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And if we Neutralize magenta, which is a 50/50 split between red and blue, the result will be a completely desaturated color since the red, green, and blue values would all be exactly the same.

It would just take a little extra work since we’d need to abstract away RGB.</p><p>Engineers use visualizations like this all the time, and the results can be useful. Take a look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Id3fU.png" rel="nofollow noopener">Teddy_the_Bear’s cartogram</a>. He diverges by adjusting gamma &amp; luminosity, resulting in darker reds and brighter blues. <a href="http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/Departments/Statistically-Significant/2014/Winter/001-The-blue-red-color-divide-in-Massachusetts.aspx#.VBW4UmSwKhk" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s a Massachusetts map</a> that does something similar by avoiding purple. Although, unlike the Neutralizing map, the blues and reds in the Massachusetts map end up changing in hue when transitioning towards their assigned neutral. There’s also professor Robert Vanderbei’s <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2012/Election2012RedWhiteBlue.png" rel="nofollow noopener">margin-of-victory/tilt maps</a>. Obvious differences are that the Neutralizing map results in a grey neutral instead of a brighter, white neutral.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
