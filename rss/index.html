Where does fertilization take place in the moss life cycle? Scroll to the Key Takeaways to get the answer, or start from the top to learn about the moss life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="reproduction">REPRODUCTION</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mosses have two forms of reproduction: <strong>sexual reproduction</strong> and <strong>asexual</strong>/ <strong>vegetative reproduction</strong>. This is true for all <strong>bryophytes</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practically all flowering plants are diploid, but for mosses, this is different. Mosses alternate between diploid generations (as sporophytes) and haploid generations (as gametophytes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sexualreproduction">SEXUAL REPRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, sexual reproduction is the process where genes from two different parents mix to produce offspring with a genetic makeup similar to, but different from, each parent.</p>
<p>The sexual reproduction of the moss (bryophyte) life cycle alternates between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte phases. In a nutshell, haploid gametophytes produce haploid gametes, which can be sperm or eggs. When egg and sperm merge, they form a diploid zygote which grows into a diploid sporophyte. Sporophytes produce haploid spores, containing genetic information from both haploid gametophyte parents. A spore gives rise to a haploid gametophyte, completing the cycle.</p>
<h4 id="gametophyte">Gametophyte</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single <strong>gametophyte</strong> moss plant can produce both sperm and eggs. This can occur on different parts of the same plant, one part producing sperm and another part producing eggs. However, a plant usually produces either all sperm-producing organs or all egg-producing organs at any one time. This way it doesn't breed with itself, promoting genetic variation. The female structure for producing eggs is known as the <strong>archegonium</strong>, and the male structure for producing sperm is known as the <strong>antheridium</strong>. Antheridia are tiny, typically stalked, club-shaped or spherical structures. Archegonia are bottle-like containers, their wall just one cell thick. Archegonia are typically formed in groups. Archegonia and antheridia are usually bundled in leaf rosettes similar to flowers, called <strong>perichaetia</strong>. Elongated club-shaped cell filaments called <strong>Paraphyse</strong> are sometimes found on the gametophyte, storing water and protecting the archegonia sand antheridia from drying up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the antheridia are ripe and the flower gets wet from rain, numerous <strong>antherozoids</strong> (spermatozoids / sperm cells), are released. Antherozoids are only able to move underwater. They swim using two threadlike tails. Some successfully end up on female gametophyte moss plants and are chemically attracted to the archegonium. Each archegonium holds one egg, in a swollen section called the <strong>venter</strong>. The sperm enter the archegonium through the narrow channel in its <strong>neck</strong>. Fertilization occurs in the archegonium to form a diploid <strong>zygote</strong>. Once one archegonium in a group has been fertilized, in many cases the others lose the ability to be fertilized. This is caused by an inhibitory hormone released from the fertilized archegonium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formation of the zygote begins the second phase of the moss life cycle, where the zygote develops into a diploid <strong>sporophyte</strong> (spore-plant).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sporophyte">Sporophyte</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After fertilization, the archegonium on the gametophyte plant becomes modified into a protective sheath around the young sporophyte. The sporophyte begins to grow by mitosis (diploid cell division) out of the top of the archegonium. It elongates and after a few cell divisions begins differentiation. At this point the sporophyte is practically a parasite on the gametophyte plant, although it may produce some food of its own via photosynthesis in the early stages of growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The embryonic sporophyte consists of three structures: a foot, seta, and a capsule. The <strong>foot</strong>, on the lower portion, anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte via penetration and helps to transfer water and nutrients from the gametophyte. The <strong>seta</strong> is a long erect supporting stalk. At the end of the sporophyte is a pod-like <strong>capsule</strong> where <strong>spores</strong> are produced. The seta only occurs in species where the mature capsule is stalked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer cells</strong> develop at the sporophyte-gametophyte boundary in the majority of bryophytes, but not all. These specialized cells allow efficient transfer of nutrients from the gametophyte to the sporophyte. They may form on the gametophyte, sporophyte, or both. The gametophyte-sporophyte junction is often convoluted and maze-like. This increases the surface area, allowing for more transfer cells than a simple boundary, thus increasing the rate at which nutrients can flow to the sporophyte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A capsule may contain four to over a million spores, depending on the species. It also may be stalked or stalkless depending on the species. In most mosses, the mouth of the capsule is covered by a lid-like <strong>operculum</strong>, which falls off when the spores are mature. A membranous hood, the <strong>calyptra</strong>, which is also discarded at maturity, further protects the operculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In wet conditions the spores can't travel very far. A tiny tooth-like structure around the mouth of the capsule controls the release of the spores. These structures, called the <strong>peristome</strong>, consist of one or two rows of teeth. They prevent the release of the spores during wet conditions by remaining closed. In dry conditions they open, releasing the spores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each spore contains a mix of genes from the two parents. If the spore falls onto a damp area of ground, it may <strong>germinate</strong> into a branching, threadlike filamentous <strong>protonema</strong>. Cusps bud from the protonema then grow into leafy male or female gametophytes, completing the life cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asexualreproduction">ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to sexual reproduction, mosses can reproduce asexually (vegetatively). The method they use to accomplish this depends on the situation they're in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the stem of a large clump of moss dies back, the stem-less clump becomes individual plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When bits of the stem or even a single leaf from the moss plant are broken off, these bits can then regenerate to form a new plant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keytakeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the moss life cycle, fertilization takes place in the archegonium of the gametophyte.</li>
<li>Mosses have diploid and haploid generations.</li>
<li>Gametophytes, spores, sperm, and eggs are all haploid.</li>
<li>Zygotes and their resulting sporophytes are diploid.</li>
<li>Mosses can reproduce sexually or asexually.</li>
<li>Moss sperm-release needs the rain, but spore-release needs it to not be raining.</li>
<li>The sporophyte is nourished at least partially by the gametophyte. If they didn't belong to the same species, we'd classify the the sporophyte as a parasite of the gametophyte.</li>

The analyst, wanting a clearer picture of the political landscape, breaks the original map down to a county-level:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xOe9Jyk2qTKtcYTzehCAJA.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>With this graph, the analyst can see that the states are a patchwork of red and blue counties. But there’s an unanswered question. Did every single person inside a given county cast the same vote? Or, were the voters within the counties divided? This graph doesn’t show this information. It just shows which choice won, even if it was by one vote. So we decide to blend each county’s red and blue vote ratios together, instead of letting the winner take all. This way if we get a pure red or pure blue county, then we know that everybody casted the same vote. And if we get a purple county, then the voters were divided. This is the result:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yp4SwnfvIA9vs_e-e_gbyg.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>A nice blend revealing smooth purple transitions between red and blue regions. We can now see that there was hardly a landslide victory in any county. But there’s still a problem. When looking at some of the purple counties, it can be hard to decipher if the purple is leaning more towards red or blue. And it gets difficult the closer the counties get to 50/50 red/blue. In fact a R&gt;B county can be confused as a R&lt;B county depending on adjacent colors. In an attempt to see the margins within the counties, we end up with something that’s close, but no cigar. What’s wrong?</p><p>The problem is that in the purple map we’re no longer discerning between two distinct hues (a specific red hue and specific blue hue), but an indiscrete number of purple hues found in-between red and blue.</p><p>Magenta (I will call purple this from now on) is what our brain registers when we observe an equal mixture of red and blue light with the absence of green. We created the purple map because pure red and pure blue counties didn’t show us the vote margins. But <em>the purple hues are nonsense</em>. We end up looking for the quality of red-ness or blue-ness inside each purple hue to create sense. We don’t need purple at all.</p><p><strong><strong>So is there a way for us to blend together red and blue hues without creating any new nonsensical hues in the process?</strong></strong></p><p>Of course! We add green, and we get a Neutralizing election map:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*og37eRaKv4pe7_2vIAkvPw.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Interesting. How does this work? Basic color theory.</p><p>We can describe all colors as combinations of Red, Green, and Blue light. Earlier, we established that Magenta is the mixture of Red and Blue light, with the key absence of Green. But we don’t have any reservations about the absence of green for our purposes. We just want to create a gradient between red and blue. So instead of falling victim to Magenta, we can use Green to neutralize the purple-ranged colors.</p><p>For a given purple-ranged hue, if we take the weaker intensity value of that purple’s Red and Blue components — let’s call that value J — and then set the purple’s green component to that J value, the purple disappears. What’s left behind is either red or blue- whichever one was stronger in the original purple.</p><p>So if we take RGB[175/0/150] and Neutralize it to RGB[175/150/150], then the red hue sticks out, with some desaturation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gM4VXa18eCFiehDA-mNytw.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If we take RGB[150/0/175] and Neutralize it to RGB[150/150/175], then the blue hue sticks out, with some desaturation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DfnsVryvN6oB61dUcHRr8g.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And if we Neutralize magenta, which is a 50/50 split between red and blue, the result will be a completely desaturated color since the red, green, and blue values would all be exactly the same.

Thanks to this neutralizing algorithm we can pit two hues against each other and only one of the original 2 hues will be the resulting victor. No new hues! The only hues on the Neutralizing map are hue#0/hue#360 (Red) and hue#240 (Blue). So now the degree of red/blue saturation reveals the margins.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BOc-Vc6hQdm-xdzbEwo21w.gif" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If a county even has the slightest hint of color saturation, then that color is that county’s marginal vote. There can be no dispute. This allows us to observe minute margins, such as a 49/51 red/blue split. *But there are limits to how nuanced the margins can be, since RGB’s 8-bit color-space can’t accept too many significant figures.</p><p>This Neutralizing Map can bring to our attention things we didn’t notice before — such as the blue streak in the Bible Belt isolated from the reds by a grey buffer, which doesn’t really call out to us in the Purple map.</p><p>Here’s how relative voter-turnout appears on the Neutralizing graph:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_hqs_SKOp2ispNGSEloROQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Trouble with the Purple Election Map"><figcaption>Notes: Counties with lower opacity had fewer votes. — 440 counties had a total vote count above the upper fence of 63,239.5 and are fully opaque — Alaska does not provide county-level data.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The principle behind the neutralizing map algorithm can work for all sets of colors. For example, we can neutralize a graph that has 4 fields represented by red, green, orange, and yellow. Grey would still be the intermediary between all the hues. It would just take a little extra work since we’d need to abstract away RGB.</p><p>Engineers use visualizations like this all the time, and the results can be useful.
